    In ancient Rome, there was the habit of celebrating the birthday of a person. 
    There weren’t parties like we know today, but cakes were prepared and offers were made.
    Then, the habits of wishing happy birthday, giving gifts and lighting candles became popular,
    as a way to protect the birthday person from devils and ensure good things to the next year,
     in the person’s life. The celebrations only became popular like we know today after fourteen,
      centuries, in a collective festival performed in Germany.

    I had a great weekend. My wife and I got married 30 years ago. 
    My wife and I were really surprised when our son came to our house on Thursday evening. 
    He then took us to the airport and gave us two tickets to go to Rome! He paid for everything: 
    the flight, the hotel, everything. We had a lovely weekend. 
    We remembered the night we got married. It was wonderful.
